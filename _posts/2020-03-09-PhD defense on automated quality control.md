I defended my PhD today.
This was cool to present three years of research to people who came specifically to hear it.
I got good questions, nothing too prepared.
I am also a bit proud of all the honours I got, I think it was maybe too much.
Maybe I have done a more than the mean job?

I have to thank Maurice and Ã‰ric for all the support during these years.

#TODO: Put the YouTube here
