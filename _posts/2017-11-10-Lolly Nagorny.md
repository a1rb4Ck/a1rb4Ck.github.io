_Life of Лолий Нагорный, my great grand-father._  
On september 14, 2017 I got an email on my university address from a russian historian, Dmitriy. He probably got my email from academic papers I published earlier this year.
He was studying the russian emigration to Europe and USA, after the october 1917 revolution.
I will be eternerly grateful to the Internet magic for all my finding to come.

He asked me if _Nagorny Leon (Lolly) K._, born 1880-1895 was from my family.  
So I asked my father because I did not know my great grand father name. Yes, Lolly was mine.  
The historian said that Lolly was a russian emigrate, lived in France between WW1 and WW2, then after WW2 lived in Russia.  
Everything was right, except the last part.
For my family, Lolly died at the end of WW2 in Germany when the factory where he had been forced to work was raid.  

Strange. I started searching historical records, as I am quite good at reading papers.
I found that the historian said truth.
So I asked my grand father for confirmation.
He said yes, breaking a thirty years old family secret.
My grand father kept writting to his father after WW2, like Lolly's wife, and sending him money.
This had probably been a secret because of the ongoing Cold War, as my grand-father was a rocket engineer during this time, with a classified state aggrements.  


Lolly had a really strange life.  
Borned in Rostov-on-Don, Urkrain, as a century started.
First, fighting in the russian white army against the red revolution.
Then for ten years, a cool life in Paris, France, as a russian G7 taxi driver, like many russian emigrate.  
During the next war World War 2, he was forced to work in Germany.  
Then liberated, but captured by russian soviets as he was not bolchevic enough.  
So he was goulaged for twenty five years.
He just lost a leg, so he was liberated after ten years.
He came back to Rostov-on-Don, USSR, back at his beginning.

I wrote a synthesis [on geni.com](https://www.geni.com/people/Lolly-Nagorny/4077609233470022225), maybe it could help others.

## 1920s-30s interwar period

He arrived in France in the coal mining Denain city, in the north.
He was a miner.
Then he went to Paris.
He worked at the Panhard & Levassor automobile factory.  

He met his russian born wife Valentine (Valentina) Siversky at this time, in Paris.
It was Valentine sister, Hélène, who attracted her to France, to be with her in Paris.
Valentine's parents lived in Bakhmount (Бахмут).
Her father Iakov Siversky, was an engineer.
He constructed the Kiev-Bakhmount train line.  


Lolly and Valentine lived in Chaville, near Versailles, then in a house in Porchefontaine.  
Lolly was a taxi driver in the G7 taxi company.
That’s why my grand-father always takes G7 taxis because he’s sure there are good and safe taxis.  
Then they move to Clichy, where his wife stay.

At this time, the russian emigrate writter [Teffi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teffi) was alone in Paris. So she became friend with Valentine.
They helped each other.
They are buried in the [russian cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Genevi%C3%A8ve-des-Bois_Russian_Cemetery) in Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois.

## 1940s Second World War

During World War 2, when nazi germans occupied the half-north of France, 
taxis were requisitionned.
So Lolly lost his job.
A Compulsory Labor deal was proposed: for three french workers who go to german factory, one french prisonner was released.
And some money was give to the family.  
So Lolly went to a berlin factory for his family to have money.  

At the end of the war, russian soviets liberated the factory.
But he was not released.
He was captured.  



## 1950s

So he was sent to a gulag from 07/29/1947, for _ASA_ and _ASD_.
He was a mine scout, in Mine No. 64., near Perm.

## 1960s

He lost a leg, so he was liberated after (only) ten years.
He came back to Rostov-on-Don, USSR, were he was born.  

Lolly lived in Rostov, with the widow that his father Konstantin Nagorny employed at the beginning of the century.

My grand-father did not know Lolly's death.  
Lolly’s wife Valentine write him letters and send him parcels.  
It was impossible for my grand-father to visit his father in Rostov because of the ongoing Cold War.

He probably lived until the 70s.
