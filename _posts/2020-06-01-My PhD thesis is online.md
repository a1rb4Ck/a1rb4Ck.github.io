I defended my [PhD](/tags/#phd) [three months ago](https://a1rb4ck.github.io/PhD-defense-on-automated-quality-control/).
It is now online on [my phd thesis repository](https://github.com/a1rb4Ck/phd), and as a [website](https://a1rb4ck.github.io/phd/).  
I should found many typos in the future, so it should live on git / GitHub.  
Maybe I should translate it?

Two pages, for sure, must be translated and blogged, [Acknowledgements](https://a1rb4ck.github.io/phd/index.html#pf3) and [Epigraph](https://a1rb4ck.github.io/phd/index.html#pf5):


### [Acknowledgements](https://a1rb4ck.github.io/phd/index.html#pf3)

These few lines will not be enough to thank all those who must be.
The reader will have to carry out a bibliographic search to gather the complete list of these people: co-authors, members of work groups, doctoral students of the SISEO Doctoral School in 2017-2020, students of the IUT of Annecy and the Polytech Annecy engineering school which have been excellent guinea pigs.


I would like to thank Professors Christophe Cudel and Fabrice Mériaudeau for their interest in this work and for their detailed comments which have made it possible to improve this manuscript.
Thank you to Professor Gilles Régnier for agreeing to chair the jury; as well as to Messrs Ronan Le Goff, Émilio Vitale for their presence on D-Day and their help for the realization of industrial experimental tests, essential to advance in my work.


I particularly thank Éric Pairel and Maurice Pillet for:  
- the ideal direction of this research work,  
- their infallible human support,  
- sharing their academic, professorial and research experiences.  
The funding for this work and its accomplishment could not have been obtained without their persistence.  

I would like to thank BPI France and, in general, France's effort to finance Research.
Thank you to the University Libraries for their work of preservation of reference works, and to all the Internet sites which make a vast knowledge freely accessible, [HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/), [arXiV](https://arxiv.org/), [Science-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) which made possible the bibliographic study.  

This line allows me to effectively thank all the members of the SYMME laboratory in Annecy-Le Bourget-du-Lac for the good atmosphere they maintain.
I have great memories of all the fruitful discussions that have allowed me to deepen or to germinate ideas.
Thank you to researchers, engineers, administrators and doctoral students for having enlivened all these moments; especially my office neighbor Orlando; the top corridor: Amandine, Florian, Jérémy, Koki, Luc, Marine, Mathias, Mickaël, Thomas, Thomas, Thomas; the bottom corridor: Amélie, Aurélien, Christian, Ludovic, Mathias, Thibault; the neighbors of IREGE / RES label: Camille, Caroline, Olga; the neighbors of Le Bourget, Jean, Marie; and for additive manufacturing Blaise and Hugues.  


On the family side, I owe huge thanks to my grandparents, my model parents - Monique and Fred -, the wonderful Margot and a happy child who brightened up the writing of this manuscript.  


Finally, thank you, readers, who bring this manuscript to life.
I hope that it will allow you to obtain answers or that it will be able to create many questions, while entertaining you, before falling asleep.

My grandparents experienced the storm.  
In 2000, I was eight years old, there was no storm at home. I went to school.  
In 2027, my daughter will turn eight years old. I hope there will be no storm.
