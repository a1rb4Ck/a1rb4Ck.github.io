I have been working for six months as a postdoc on the following of my PhD.
[I got fund](/2019-08-15-Academic fundraising) from Linksium.
You can check [TheEye website](https://the-eye.fr/).

Objectives are:  
- get a big dataset  
- supervised Deep transfer Learning for defect detection
- unsupervised learning to avoid human bias
- assist the human expert for the annotation task

A good amount of works will go in the hardware integration of new industrial grade sensors.  

Everything must be packed into [TheEye](/tags/#theeye).
