Industrial systems are ugly.
It is easy to do better.
Everyone is speaking about _Industry 4th revolution_, but we are not in the future.
Everything is still ugly.

> Of two products that are the same in price, function and quality, whichever is more beautiful will sell better

Beauty sells.  
Making a nice looking product is not so much expansive than an ugly one, but it will sell better.

I designed a quality control system which looks like an eye.
To continue on personification motto, it is called it TheEye.
It's a sphere, with a central hole for the camera and annular lighting for maximum efficiency.

Then, as a sphere, the design constraints the hardware integration.
Most electronics are square shaped, so you lose a bit of space.

Now, let's integrate the hardware.
