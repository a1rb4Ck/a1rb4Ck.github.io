I defended my PhD a month ago.  
Preparing the defense was bizarre. Without a critical last week overview from my supervisors, I would have miss the plot.  

Why? I spent three years digging a topic.
When I began, neither me nor my supervisors had a complete view on it.
This was about machine learning applied to the control of the injection molding process.  
So I spent march preparing the defense at night, postdocing on days.  

## PhD defense slides

I wanted to use State Of The Art keynote tooling.  
Like every academics, I have been into `\documentclass{beamer} \usetheme{Frankfurt}`.
So I builded a complete webapp with the great [`reveal.js`](https://revealjs.com/).
This was awesome. I was able to stream the plot in realtime on the web, integrate `<iframe>` and many interactive [`Plotly.js`](https://plotly.com/javascript/) 3D plots.

Wait, but man was it ugly..  
I strugle to design a nice looking template. And then, integrating multiple `<img>` in the same slide needed to master precise css `margin-top: 1.45px` metrics.
When I show it a week before to it was still ugly. And it was mostly half finished. A shame when you had three years to did it.

So I followed the experienced professors, and go with PowerPoint. Overnight, from Monday to Tuesday, it was completly redone with a slick design.

## PhD defense plot
Another big part of my strugling was the plot.  
At first I tried to make an overview of my two hundred and a half pages manuscript.  

Do not do that.  

A defense is more like two or three papers put togethers with a catchy intro and many perspectives to guide the debate.  


So, this was how I learned to PhD defense.
Then, talking for three hours of my research was really easy and fun.
