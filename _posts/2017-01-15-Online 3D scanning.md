At the [IPC technical center](https://ct-ipc.com/), we ran a design Of experiments to screen the injection molding process ([Plackett â€“ Burman N12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plackett%E2%80%93Burman_design)).
This was done within the FUI SAPRISTI reseach project.

We integrate a maximum of different sensors on the production line: inmold pressure and temperature, mass, photography, thermography and 3D scanning.
The robot guarantees the temporal repeatability of all measurements.

The experiments ran for a full week.
The main limits was thermal management of the mold.
It has a big thermal inertia, so we must wait between trials, and always increase the temperature.

This was a fun first PhD experiment.
