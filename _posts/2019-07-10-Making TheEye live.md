So [I have an eye](/Designing-the-futur-of-industrial-systems).
How can I make it livy?

{% include figure image_path="/assets/img/TheEye - design_jan2019.png" alt="TheEye quality control system" caption="TheEye design, January 2019" %}

I made it blink.

<div class="responsive-video-container">
    <video width="100%" alt="Video of TheEye blinks" controls>
      <source src="/assets/img/TheEye-live_feb2019.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
</div>

Ah, and hello newborn.
