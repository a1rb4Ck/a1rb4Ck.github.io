My first academic paper was reviewed a month ago. Not without any critics.
I got two A4 pages, one peer reviewers.
And I should deeply thanks them.
Too bad they were anonymous.  

Althought, those were more about form and argumentation than content.  
I had rushed the writing, and of course it showed. I am not proud.  

Do not rush the writing of an academic paper.  

Not even for yourself. But for the benevolant scientists who will read it.  

Finally, the paper was accepted. And the CIVEMSA2017 venue was nice.  
You can find it [here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01552111).

It compares classic neural networks (CNN, LSTM) with advanced regressions methods to predict the geometry of an injection molding part, for quality control.
Neural networks worked the best.

### Things I learn:
- do not rush a scientific writing (not even a blog post?)  
- anticipate deadlines  
- carefuly proofread with a team
