Every year, my doctoral school have a PhD students day, were self-made videos presenting their lab are shared.
This automn, I filmed, directed, edited the 2018 video presentation of the lab.  

It's on YouTube.

I tried to mimic the David Fincher director style - in Gone Girl, 2014.
Many students ticked on compensated traveling shots.
For the record, they were made with a high speed roller stool and proper hand-zoom synchronization.

If you want the same looking video for your research lab, you can hire me as a postdoc.
