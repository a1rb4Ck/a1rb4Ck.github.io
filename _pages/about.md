### about this website
I'm hoping to have time soon to aggregate & synthesis my thoughts and current projects.

### about me
I am a PhD student working on optimal machines control, applied to the injection molding process.
Objectives are to garanting a perfect final product quality and to reduce the process set-up time.
I develop (deep) machine learning methods.
I am driven about robotics and realistic motions, thus I prototype various autonomous systems with original motions.

Some time before I:
- got an mechatronics engineering degree
- spent good months in Gothenburg
- was an intern at the beginning of a watchmaking startup, with a nice Kickstarter campaign.
- learnt to code the Lego RCX H8/300 in C
