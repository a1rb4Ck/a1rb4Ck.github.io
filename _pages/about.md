### About this website
I am hoping to have time soon to aggregate & synthesis my thoughts and current projects.

### About me
I am a PhD student working on optimal machines control, applied to the injection molding process.  
Objectives are to garanting a perfect final product quality and to reduce the process set-up time.  
I develop (deep) machine learning methods.  
I am driven about robotics and realistic motions, thus I prototype various autonomous systems with original motions.  

Some time before I:
* got an mechatronics engineering degree 
* spent good studying months in Gothenburg
* was an intern at the beginning of a watchmaking startup, with a nice <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1221639153/watches-to-travel-through-time">Kickstarter</a> campaign.
* learnt to program the Lego RCX H8/300 in C
