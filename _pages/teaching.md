- Static mechanics, spring 2017 & 2018  
  Engineering problems solving: Multiple bodies physics and mechanisms design, only with constants forces (thus, "static").  
  Practical works with the help of <a href="https://www.enventive.com/en/">Enventive</a> & <a href="https://www.ansys.com">ANSYS</a> softwares.  
- Dynamic mechanics, spring 2017 & 2018  
  Following the previous courses, general mechanics problems solving with complex 3D motions.  
  Hints and solutions in Jupyter IPython notebooks. <a href="https://github.com/a1rb4Ck/MECA654">Link to notebooks</a>.  
  Practical works with the Solid Dynamics software (purchased by AutoDesk and integrated into Inventor).  

### Science in elementary school
- Robot programming in Elementary school, winter 2018  
  Programming <a href="http://thymio.org/">Thymio</a> robots with <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/">Blockly</a>.  
  6-7 years old students learned really fast!  
  We also debate about robotics and AI, raised ethical concerns.  

### Teaching interests
